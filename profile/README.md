# Real-Time Strategy Simulation Engine (RTSEngine)

A real-time strategy (RTS) engine built on a custom Entity‚ÄìComponent‚ÄìSystem (ECS) architecture.  
Designed for large-scale unit simulation, deterministic updates, and modern rendering pipelines.

## HELP WANTED!
### We are looking for the following roles:
- üé® Sprite Artist (16x16 / 32x32 retro assets)
- üíª Graphics Programmer (render pipeline, instancing, shaders)
- üéÆ Systems Programmer (ECS gameplay systems)
- üåê Network Programmer (deterministic lockstep)

If you are interested, please [email us](mailto:harrybridgen@gmail.com) or [message on discord](https://discord.com/users/172272486430408704).

### Note
This is currently an unpaid project.
However, the long-term vision is to build and release commercial RTS games powered by RTSEngine. 
Contributors who join now will not only help shape a groundbreaking proprietary RTS engine but may also have opportunities to share in future success once games are published.

### Why RTSEngine is unique:
- Capable of simulating 40k‚Äì60k active units with collisions and combat at 60 FPS.
- Built for deterministic large-scale RTS battles.
- Aimed at creating a new kind of RTS experience: true epic-scale battles combined with RTS gameplay depth.

## Overview

This project explores how to scale RTS mechanics to tens of thousands of units while preserving responsiveness and visual clarity.  
It is part of our research into simulation-heavy game architectures.

Core goals:
- **Scalability**: handle tens of thousands of active entities.
- **Determinism**: fixed-step updates for consistent replays/network sync.
- **Performance**: parallel simulation and GPU-driven rendering.
- **Flexibility**: extensible ECS design for future mechanics.
